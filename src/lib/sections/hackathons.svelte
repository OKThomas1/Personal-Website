						BC Hacks 3 <span class="text-warning">&#11088; Best Start-up Idea (Top Prize) </span>

					<p class="card-text">
						At BC Hacks 3, I joined forces with a group of masters students from the University of
						Calgary to create a social media platform for connecting mentors and mentees. Our
						website enabled users to sign up as either a mentor or mentee, and then swipe left or
						right on a number of profiles that were determined to be the best match based on our
						custom algorithm. My main contribution was building the backend, including
						authorization, routing, and API design, as well as writing the docker script to run the
						website. Our tech stack included React, Django, Bootstrap, AWS, and Docker.

					</h6>
					<p class="card-text">
						In BC Hacks 4, I worked with 3 friends to create a program that transforms old computers
						into cloud computers. Our program enabled the computer admin to create and manage users
						that can upload nodejs scripts, create mysql databases, and host static websites. My
						role involved designing and building the entire backend, including routing, API design,
						and writing the setup script. I was also responsible for connecting the backend to the
						frontend created by my team. Our tech stack included Svelte, Django, MySQL, and
						Bootstrap.
