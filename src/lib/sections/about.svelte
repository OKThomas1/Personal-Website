		My name is Thomas, I am currently a 4th year student studying Computer Science and Data Science
		at the University of British Columbia Okanagan.
		<br />
		<br />
		When I was young I really liked math and spent a lot of time on Khan Academy. One day I came across
		a Javascript course and immediately fell in love with coding.
